# Aurora Music

A YouTube Music–style streaming web app: live catalog with the latest releases, charts and trending songs, mood-based listening sessions, full search, and a complete player (queue, shuffle, repeat, lyrics, autoplay) in a dark, Apple-inspired interface with soft motion.

| Layer  | Tech                                                                        |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client | React 19 · TypeScript · Vite · React Router · Zustand · Framer Motion        |
| Server | Node 20+ · Express — normalizes the catalog API and decrypts stream URLs     |
| Audio  | Native `<audio>` streaming 320 kbps AAC (highest tier the catalog provides)  |

Songs, albums, artists, playlists, charts, lyrics and artwork come from the JioSaavn web catalog, so every new release is available the moment it is published there. The Express server is the only thing that talks to the catalog; the browser talks to `/api/*`.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Web app: https://aurora-the-music.onrender.com/

### Production

```bash
npm run build      # builds client/dist
npm start          # serves the API and the built client on http://localhost:3001
```

`PORT` overrides the port.

### Tests

```bash
npm test           # server unit tests (normalizers, stream decryption, moods)
```
